## @nelreina/dotenv

package to create .env file

### Use Cases

- if you want to create a .env file using cli tool.
- To store encrypted password in your .env file

In my case I have a program that the user (IT Manager) need to configure
I created a cli tool (with inquirer js) that he can enter the config and the password will be encrypted in the file
